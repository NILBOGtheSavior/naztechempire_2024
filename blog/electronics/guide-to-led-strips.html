<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>With the wide variety of LED strips that are available on the market, purchasing and populating your home with these lights can be tedious, let alone the operation of these lights. You first need to pick your ecosystem of products (Philips, Govee, TP-Link, etc.) unless you don’t mind downloading 5 different apps to operate them. Then, you need to buy the products, which, depending on which ecosystem you landed on, could chomp away at your budget.</p>

<p>There is a movement among DIY enthusiasts and hackers that enables greater freedom when it comes to using and operating these products, which includes the usage of programs such as <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/">Home Assistant</a>, <a href="https://kno.wled.ge/">WLED</a>, and some general craftiness.</p>

<h2 id="the-basis-of-the-project">The Basis of the Project</h2>

<p>The goal of this project is to unlock the freedom to control your lights how you please. This means not relying on companies and their apps of various levels of ‘functionality’ to control the lighting in your home. While regular light bulbs may be used in your home, they are more of a plug-and-play device. LED strips, on the other hand, are more customizable and have more creative use cases.</p>

<p>The more you’re able to manipulate LED strips, the more power how have to form them into your vision. This article will show you exactly how to cut, connect, power, and program different types of LEDs.</p>

<h2 id="the-common-types-of-led-strips">The Common Types of LED Strips</h2>

<p>There are different types of LED strips, and I think these three are the common ones that are worth understanding. Note that strips come in different voltages as well:</p>

<!-- Research -->

<!-- The 3-pin strips use a common anode design, while the 4-pin strips use a common cathode design. -->
<!-- research the waterproof 5pin led strips -->
<!-- research 2-pin led strips -->

<h3 id="2-pin-strips">2-Pin Strips</h3>

<h4 id="pinout">Pinout</h4>

<p class="reduceImage50"><img src="/img/blog/custom_led_strips/2-pin.jpg" alt="Pinout of 2-Pin LED Strip" title="Pinout of 2-Pin LED Strip" /></p>

<h3 id="3-pin-strips">3-Pin Strips</h3>

<p>3-Pin strips are pretty cool. They are known as <strong>Addressable RGB LED Strips</strong>, meaning that, you have control over the individual LEDs in the strip. Another common name for them is <strong>Neopixels</strong>. Their design allows you to animate the strips and light different sections in different colors. With this advanced functionality, Neopixels are generally the more pricey option. I wouldn’t recommend lighting up an entire room with Neopixels (unless you’re like, loaded or something), but rather, use them in a smaller environment, such as around the edges of your desk, or behind your TV unit.</p>

<p><em>These are commonly available in 5v or 12v</em></p>

<h4 id="pinout-1">Pinout</h4>

<p class="reduceImage50"><img src="/img/blog/custom_led_strips/3-pin.jpg" alt="Pinout of 3-Pin LED Strip" title="Pinout of 3-Pin LED Strip" /></p>

<h3 id="4-pin-strips">4-Pin Strips</h3>

<p>4-Pin strips are the more common and affordable smart lighting option. Unlike the 3-Pin light strips, they are <strong>Non-Addressable RGB LED Strips</strong>. This means that they are (generally) controlled as one unit<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Due to their affordability, these are more suited to light larger areas, such as entire rooms, underneath cabinets, inside wardrobes, etc.</p>

<p><em>These are commonly available in 12v or 24v</em></p>

<h4 id="pinout-2">Pinout</h4>

<p class="reduceImage50"><img src="/img/blog/custom_led_strips/4-pin.jpg" alt="Pinout of 4-Pin LED Strip" title="Pinout of 4-Pin LED Strip" /></p>

<h3 id="5-pin-strips">5-Pin Strips</h3>

<p>There are different types of 5-pin strips, but the more common one is the RGBW strip, which has a separate LED for white light<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. There are other types of 5-pin LED strips, for example, there are some that include 2 extra channels to be able to daisy-chain the data lines, while the 2 extra channels are to run extra power to the LEDs. This would make sense for huge projects, or maybe outdoor LEDs alongside your driveway.</p>

<h4 id="pinout-3">Pinout</h4>

<p class="reduceImage50"><img src="/img/blog/custom_led_strips/5-pin.jpg" alt="Pinout of 5-Pin LED Strip" title="Pinout of 5-Pin LED Strip" /></p>

<h2 id="snipping-and-connecting">Snipping and Connecting</h2>

<p>Most strips have dotted lines you can cut across. These are safe areas for you to cut, where you won’t break any of the circuitry required to power and transfer data to the LEDs. The LED strips should be fitted so that they are optimally snipped to size, evenly lighting the desired area.</p>
<div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote">
      <p>Some 4-pin LED strips are lit in zones, meaning that there is a level of addressability to them, for example, there is a model of TP-Link Casa Smart home strips that are zone-lit and have built-in animations. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:2" role="doc-endnote">
      <p>LED strips without the white diode mix all three colored diodes to create the illusion of white light. <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>
